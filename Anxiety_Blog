Things often do not happen the way we expect. This is one common situation that triggers anxiety. It reached to an extent where everything started to feel never interesting and every small problem started to seem so big. 
Not everything can be shared with friends and family. Especially, in my case, certain outcomes when they tunrn out to be unexpectedly negative or ignorance of the people in crucial times trigger extreme anxiety and make me feel purposeless. 
I had no clue how to overcome and simply detach from whats happening. As its perfectly said in Gita, only actions are in our control and never its fruits. Very true, but following seems to be hard. Everytime this happens, I feel like fighting a war against myself. 
On one hand, I try to convince myself that anything happens in life is temporary no matter what. Whether its success, failure, happy, sad. These emotions last for a shorter period. Yet, knowingly I fight overcoming negative emotions. On the other hand
showing up myself problem free and happy to the loved ones around me is another great war keeps going. While I ponder over these random thoughts of how to attain self-realization and keep myself cool and calm all the time without too much 
concerned about what happens next, this came to my mind: why can't I express my feelings in words and get rid of the fear of failure and anxiety. Here are my uncontrollable random thoughts that put me under stress and make me weak. 

1. Personal life: Relationship, the biggest question mark. For many years, I never concerned about it. Now, the time has come. Many doubts, questions started to flood. Questions that always put me in confusion: Is it compulsary for me to marry? Yeah, maybe right person 
can add strength? What if I end up in wrong hands? How to decide? And I have no definitive answers to these questions. The next immediate question blinks. Why can't I simply give up on this? But I don't want to. One harsh truth is that, marriages 
often involve families. The sad truth is that there is hardly any family members who can take it forward on behalf of me. 
2. Professional life: There is a whole ocean of interesting and long stading problems to be addressed. Very exciting. I am lifetime indebt to God for where I have reached today despite countless odds. Never ever imagined that I would reach here one day.
Everything feels like a miracle. Never imagined that I would dare to escape from the forced engagement arranged by family memebrs. The next step is to wrap of my research here and take up a job. 

Not certain about anything. Maybe, I will do a short research on how to control anxiety and share my research outcomes with you soon...
