Hey, this is Anuradha. I am currently a PhD scholar in EE department at IIT Hyderabad. Before joining here, I did my BTech in ECE dept. from RGUKT, IIIT, Basar. I have a short time industry experinece of working as an Intern TCS R&I, Bengaluru. I worked on an interesting problem of multimodal biomedical image registration for the image fusion task. My current research is about developing efficient and accurate representation learning algorithms for Visual Place Recognition or Visual Geolocalization, which is critical in robotics. My research interests include representation learning, representation similarity analysis, image/video quality assessment, etc. Broadly, I am excited addressing problems in computer vision, deep learning, and signal processing.
